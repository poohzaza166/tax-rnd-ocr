Managing financial documents such as receipts, invoices, and tax return statements can be fastidious,
time-consuming and prone to human error. It’s a process individuals and businesses, whether small or
big, deal with on a daily basis. A pain point that these people experience is manual data entry which
can be divided into two main ways, pen and paper and a calibration system. The former’s approach is
filling out paper forms which are later manually typed into a computer. However, the average rate of
data entry from paper documents ranges between 10,000 and 15,000 keystrokes (Gopal, 2021) which
calculates up to about an hour. This time could be directed towards other areas of concern such as a
business wanting to take this time to plan and optimize the production of their products. The latter can
be described as using a dedicated calibration software or Excel sheet to insert data. Much like before,
the data is still being entered manually which takes up time and a fact not yet mentioned is the
potential for data to be written incorrectly with a 4% chance for a single keyed data. (Zaugg, 2016).
This can be attributed to a number of different reasons such as inadequate training, misinterpretation
or just a slight slip-up in typing. A 4% chance is critical as most people can’t afford to make a single
mistake, an example of this comes from AT&T where they discovered they were overpaying in
invoices and purchases by tens of millions of dollars (Redman, 2014). When errors in managing data
occur, a lot of time will be wasted tracking down and fixing the data. This would potentially lead to
other problems along the line such as a loss of reputational damage affecting investors.
Furthermore, having inaccurate or unreliable data may lead to tax auditing. This is when tax guidelines
are not met and tax officials may have to perform an investigation into financial statements. It’s an
unfortunate situation that individuals and businesses do not want to face and therefore an important
part of data entry should be checking that every part of it is correct.
There are existing solutions that individuals and businesses employ when facing manual data entry
problems. This could be double checking the dataset. Though this will reduce errors, it is still time
consuming and is not dependable all the time. Another method would be training the correct staff to
potentially avoid making amateur mistakes. But, again, human errors are still to occur and it may
increase the cost of having to train these people.
